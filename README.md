# Classroom Master Lockdown

> A GitHub App built with [Probot](https://github.com/probot/probot)

This probot app fills in a gap within GitHub's Classroom functionality to allow for automatically creating branch protection rules on repository creation.

Currently it is designed for Org-level usage in conjunction with GitHub Classroom generated repositories.

Future iterations may include the ability to handle configuration beyond the default, 1 reviewer requirements.
